## Talk about  a movie you watched recently that you felt disappointed with

You should say:
Why you didn't like it
Why you decided to watch it
And explain why you felt disappointed about it

> I recently watched "Fast and Furious 10" and ended up feeling disappointed. As a fan of the "Fast and Furious" series, I had high expectations for this new installment, but it didn't meet them.
>
> The movie's plot revolves around Dominic Toretto and his team being manipulated by a drug lord's son, leading to a series of revenge conflicts.
>
> The first reason for my disappointment was the convoluted plot. The film tried to weave too many characters and subplots, resulting in a scattered narrative that was hard to follow. Crucial plot turns, such as Dante's revenge and the betrayals involving Aimes and Dante, felt rushed and lacked depth.
>
> Secondly, the action scenes, while visually impressive, felt repetitive and over-the-top. Scenes like Dom driving off a dam and landing safely in the water were too far-fetched and distracted from the story.
>
> In conclusion, I chose to watch "Fast and Furious 10" because I love the series and the characters, but I was left disappointed. The complex plot, excessive action scenes, and lack of real stakes made the film, in my view, fall short of its predecessors.
