# P2/3 地点类 新题

## 嘈杂地

**Describe a noisy place you have been to**
**You should say:**
	**Where it is**
	**When you went there**
	**What you did there**
	**And explain why you feel it's a noisy place**

可以几乎完全串用保留题中的《运动场所》，只需要解释到为什么那个故事里面的运动场很noisy就行

> **I live in a major city and it’s  busy everywhere! So, I think most places are noisy, but today I would like to talk about my city’s recently renovated sports stadium, which is a noisy place because it is a very popular place.** The stadium is mainly used for several sports-related activities and even professional competitions. I have been to this stadium several times, and I would like to share my opinion about it. The stadium is located at the city centre because it was **the landmark of the city** decades ago. I remember that it can accommodate over 20,000 spectators at a time. 
>
> I have been to this stadium twice to watch soccer competitions in the past few years and watched a concert once. I have to say, during these events, this place was **jam-packed**! I **think it is a noisy place because it is always full of people. I don’t think the noise is a bad thing, it shows how energetic the city is.** It’s just a great place for local people to get together and exercise! I think this stadium is really well operated by the local government and I wish more facilities like this can be built!

**1. Do you think it is good for children to make noise?**

> Depending on the age. Young children mainly the ones that are 2 years and younger should make more noise because they are curious and learning how to speak. However, for older children, they should know about appropriate times and places to make noise and to respect the needs of others.

**2. Should children not be allowed to make noise under any circumstances**

> See 1. No. Although excessive noise or noise that is disruptive to others may not be appropriate, it is more important to teach children about appropriate times and places to make noise and to respect the needs of others rather than forbidding it.

**3. What kinds of noise are there in our life?**

> Any sound that is unpleasant and disruptive is considered noise. So, noise could be horning from cars, people chatting in a library, or the sound from the fan. It’s really depending on the circumstances.

**4. Which area is exposed to noise more, the city or the country side?**

> Definitely the city. The population density is much higher in the city and people make noise for all kinds of reasons. Traffic is worse, so the start, stop, horning from cars will make a lot of noise as well. Whereas in the countryside, it’s usually really quiet after the rush hours.

**5. How would people usually respond to noises in your country**

> It’s not a secret that there are so many people in China, so there are lots of noises. I think people, over time, just become accustomed to most noises and no longer find them to be bothersome. However, if the noise is made very inappropriately, such as answering phone calls in movie theater, people will get mad and ask the person to leave.

**6. How can people consider others' feelings when chatting in public**

> People just need to be mindful of the location. They should avoid having loud or personal conversations in quiet spaces such as libraries and museums. Also, keep the volume of your voice down. Speak at a moderate volume so that you don't disturb others around you who may be trying to focus on other things.

## 空气糟糕之地

**Describe a place you visited where the air was polluted**
**You should say:**
	**Where the place is**
	**When you visited**
	**Why the air was not good**
	**And explain how you felt about the place**

实际上并不适合串题。故单独制作故事以便于记忆

> Air pollution is a big problem in China, at least before the pandemic hit. I visited Beijing, the capital of China, a few years back, and I was surprised at how bad the pollution was. I think it was the year 2019, my friend and I planned to visit the Great Wall and also to attend a concert in Beijing. We flew to Beijing because air tickets were cheaper than traveling by high-speed rail at that time for whatever reason. Once we landed in Beijing, we immediately noticed how foggy it was. At that time, nobody wears a mask, but I really hoped I could have one because the air smells like **burning coal.**
>
> We weren’t sure whether it was just a foggy day or the air pollution, but we soon confirmed that it was the pollution when I washed my face in the hotel. There was literally dirt on my face! So, I did some research about why the air was so bad. Apparently, Beijing air pollution is mainly caused by **vehicle emissions** and **the burning of coal** to produce electricity. Other factors that influence air quality in Beijing include the manufacturing industry and population growth.
>
> I had to say Beijing is such a magical place which has so many historical buildings and modern arts and architects. However, the air quality is just unbearable for me. Fortunately, once the pandemic hit, air quality in Beijing improved a lot. I hope this could continue because good air quality is essential to people’s health!

**1. Is there more pollution now than in the past**

> Definitely now. There is more pollution now than ever before due to increased human activities. As quality-of-life increases, carbon emissions increase at the same time because more people are consuming more energy to heat, cool, and move around. Although the world is paying more attention to climate change now, it will take years for overall pollution to start decreasing.

**2. In what ways can air pollution be reduced effectively**

> Air pollution can be reduced in a variety of ways. Encouraging the use of public transportation, carpooling, and biking, and promoting the use of electric vehicles can help reduce emissions from cars and trucks. Government should also educate people about the health risks associated with air pollution, encouraging them to reduce their own emissions and encouraging them to support policies and programs that aim to reduce air pollution.

**3. Do you think the city is cleaner or dirtier than the countryside? Why?**

> It depends. I would say most cities are dirtier than the countryside because there are just way more people in the city. And people litter, that is just the reality. However, some
> countryside has no one to clean public areas which could accumulate more trash overtime.

**4. What can factories and power plants do to reduce pollutants?**

> Factories and power plants can be required to use cleaner technologies and processes, and to install equipment to control emissions. At the same time, government should encourage the use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power to help reduce emissions from power plants.

**5. Do you think many companies have been forced to reduce pollutants?**

>Yes. There is a term in business called “ESG”, environmental, social, governance. Basically, companies especially the large public companies are rated on the ESG factors, a better score usually increase the value of the company. Therefore, more and more companies are now try to reduce pollutants to improve both their image and their value.

**6. Do you think the wind has any effect on pollution? How?**

> I think so. Wind can help to disperse pollutants, such as those from industrial facilities, power plants, and vehicles, which can help to reduce their concentration in the air and improve air quality. Although the pollution is still there, as it’s less concentrated, it is not so harmful for people in a specific area anymore.
