You should say:
When you had it
Where you had it
Whom you had it with

>It was during my stay in Chengdu, a city in the Sichuan province of China, where I had this unique culinary experience. I had the meal at a local restaurant with a group of friends from my university, who were also visiting China.

>The meal was called "Hot Pot," which is a popular traditional Chinese dish. However, the version of Hot Pot that I had was unlike any other Hot Pot I had ever tasted. The broth was prepared with a variety of spices, including Sichuan pepper, which gave it a distinctive taste and numbing sensation. The ingredients that were used in the Hot Pot were also quite unusual, ranging from duck blood to beef tripe, which were not something I was accustomed to eating.

>Overall, the Hot Pot experience was unusual, exciting, and something that I will always remember. It was an opportunity for me to try new and exotic flavors and ingredients that are not commonly found in Western cuisine. The communal aspect of the Hot Pot meal, where everyone shares from the same pot, also added to the unique experience.

**1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of eating in restaurants?**
>Well, eating in a restaurant is convenient. Think about it, you lose so much time on 
preparing meals and cleaning dishes each day. Eating in a restaurant allows people to enjoy 
a wide variety of menu options while to be able to socialize with others. The major 
downside is the cost. With current high inflation condition, it’s so expensive to eat in 
restaurants! 

**2. What fast food are there in your country?**
>There are Western fast-food chains, such as McDonalds, KFC, and Burger King, which are still 
very popular. However, Chinese people just can’t be satisfied by eating burgers everyday.

**3. Do people eat fast food at home?**
>Occasionally yes. After a Korean Drama attracted public attention, people now prefer to eat 
fried chicken with beer at home while watching drama or reality shows. It’s so unhealthy 
but so delicious. So, I set a hard limit on myself to only have that combo once a month. 

**4. Why do some people choose to eat out instead of ordering takeout?**
>The reason is so simple. Takeout food usually doesn’t taste as good as food prepared and 
eaten fresh in the restaurant. Takeout food is often prepared in advance which means that 
the food may have been sitting for a while before it is consumed, which affects the taste 
and texture of the food. Since the price is the same, people technically have a better deal 
eating in the restaurant. 

**5. Do people in your country socialize in restaurants?**Why?**
>Of course. I think restaurants, in general, provide a convenient and comfortable place to 
gather with others. It also gives people good ice breakers to talk about. People often wait 
for 15-30 minutes before their ordered food gets served, and during that time, most people 
would start chatting at least about the restaurants and food. Once the conversation gets 
started, people can get to know each other better.

**6. Do people in your country value food culture?**
>Yes, food culture is highly valued in my country, with a rich culinary heritage and a diverse range of regional cuisines. Eating is not just about nourishment, but also about socializing, bonding, and celebrating cultural traditions.

## 争论

Describe a disagreement you had with someone
You should say:
Who you had the disagreement with
What the disagreement was
What happened
And explain how you felt about it
>Disagreements can arise in many different situations, and it's not uncommon for them to occur in academic and professional settings. One disagreement that comes to mind involves a disagreement with a colleague during a group project. The disagreement was about how to approach a particular task within the project. My colleague wanted to take a more traditional and straightforward approach, while I felt that a more innovative and unconventional approach would be more effective. We debated the merits of each approach for some time, and ultimately we had to compromise and come up with a hybrid approach that incorporated elements of both ideas.

>During the disagreement, I felt frustrated and a bit annoyed that my colleague wasn't seeing things from my perspective. At the same time, I recognized that my colleague had valid points, and I tried to listen to their concerns and address them as best I could. In the end, I was glad that we were able to find a compromise that worked for both of us, and I felt proud of our ability to work together and overcome our differences.

**1. What do you do if you disagree with someone?**
>When I disagree with someone, I believe it's important to communicate my viewpoint in a respectful and non-confrontational manner. I try to listen actively to their perspective and acknowledge their points before expressing my own. I also try to find common ground and explore alternative solutions that may satisfy both parties. If we still can't reach an agreement, I believe it's okay to agree to disagree and move on while maintaining a positive and constructive relationship

**2. How can we stop an argument from escalating into a fight?**
>To prevent an argument from escalating into a fight, I think it's important to remain calm and composed. I would try to avoid using accusatory language and instead focus on the issue at hand. I would also listen actively to the other person's viewpoint and acknowledge their concerns before expressing my own. If tensions are still high, taking a break and returning to the conversation when emotions have subsided can also be helpful.

**3. Who do you think should teach children to respect their teacher?**
>I believe that it's the responsibility of both parents and teachers to teach children to respect their teachers.

It's important for both parties to work together to create a supportive and respectful learning environment for children.

**4. What disagreements do parents and children usually have?**
>Parents and children can disagree on a wide range of issues, including academic performance, extracurricular activities, social media use, curfews, and household chores. These disagreements may stem from differences in values, priorities, and communication styles. It's important for both parties to listen actively to each other's concerns and work together to find solutions that are mutually agreeable. Parents can also try to empathize with their children's perspectives and involve them in decision-making processes to promote a sense of autonomy and responsibility.

We came across several waterfalls and small streams, and we even saw some wildlife like deer from a distance.

They'll discover what they like, don't like, what they are good at, and what needs improvement

跟人物类保留题（工作中的积极建议）的 P3 很像，复制过来。 
>Yes, to a certain degree. While encouragement helps children exhibit optimism and confidence, many parents nowadays spoil their kids. They encourage their kids no matter what they have done, which leads to bad habits in the long run. They should only praise and encourage their kids for the right things 

**2. Which kind of feedback do people tend to believe, positive or negative feedback?** 
>That really depends on the circumstances and the person who is giving feedback. Some people always praise others, so people tend to not take his positive feedback too seriously. Some people are very harsh on commenting others, and their positive words actually mean something for the people who are receiving them. 

**3. Do you think public recognition is important for people nowadays?** 
>Yes, absolutely. People nowadays need a sense of accomplishment, and having their contribution celebrated and appreciated by other can have a powerful effect on their motivation. Some even say that recognition, particularly in the workplace, is more important than giving a raise or a bonus.

**4.  Do you think those who have received public recognition should take on more social responsibilities?** 
>Well. It depends on which kind of public recognition. For celebrities and famous figures, I would say they should behave more responsibly because they have a great influence on others. For everyday people, their recognition usually happens at the workplace or at home, so they should not take extra social responsibilities.
